This is probably 42's longest and most detailed project: creating a UNIX Shell.
In this project, i was tasked with creating a Command Line Interface for Ubuntu
with the main funcionalities replicated: create and implement builtin commands,
other system commands found in $PATH, environment variables, signal handling,
pipes, redirections, quotes, interactive user input parsing and much, much more. 
Like every single other 42 project, it had several goals in mind:
- continued practice of basic C syntax, logic, data types and structures;
- dynamic data allocation managing;
- use of tools like GDB and Valgrind to debug, avoid memory leaks and errors;
- incomplete instructions to promote self learning and error solving;
- familiarity with Makefile and compilers;
- use of multi-rocess functions such as fork(), wait(), execve();
- use of inter-process communication with pipe();
- use of signal handling functions;
- use of <readline.h> functions to handle user input and working history;
- etc;

This project was made while studying in 42 Porto as part of the Computer Science
Common Core curriculum.
It was made according to 42's Norm for good code etiquette, which includes rules regarding:
- correct indentation;
- maximum line lenght of 81 characters;
- maximum function size of 25 lines;
- maximum 5 functions per file;
- mandatory 42 signature file header;
- forbidden use of "for", "do / while", "switch / case", "goto";
- and many others...
